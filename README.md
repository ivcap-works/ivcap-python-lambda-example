# IVCAP "Lambda" Service Demo

This repo template contains a very simplistic implementation of a
"lambda" service. A "lambda" service expects to be called on
one or more HTTP endpoints, performs some action and returns a result.
There is no guarantee that any follow-up requests are being handled by
the same instance. Therefore, any potential state needs to be either
carried in the request, or stored in IVCAP's Datafabric.

## Implementation

This service Joseph Weizenbaum's famous Eliza chat bot as a service. Eliza
doesn't keep any state between rounds of questions and therefore perfectly
matches our constraints.

The actual Eliza implementation is copied from [Wade Brainerd's](http://wadeb.com/)
['eliza' repo](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza) into [./eliza](./eliza).

### [lambda.py](.lambda.py])

For the service itself we are using [fastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

The code in [lambda.py](lambda.py) falls into the following parts:

#### Import packages

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from eliza import eliza
from signal import signal, SIGTERM
import sys
import os
```

#### Setting up a graceful shutdown for kubernetes deployments

```
signal(SIGTERM, lambda _1, _2: sys.exit(0))
```

#### Service description and general `fastAPI` setup

```
description = """
Chat with Eliza Service. ðŸš€
...
"""

app = FastAPI(
    title="Chat With Eliza",
    description=description,
    summary="Implementation of Joseph Weizenbaum's famous Eliza chat-bot.",
    version=os.environ.get("VERSION", "???"),
    ...
```

#### Initialising the Eliza _Doctor_

```
eliza = eliza.Eliza()
eliza.load('eliza/doctor.txt')
```

#### The main entry point

```
@app.post("/")
def root(said: str):
    response = eliza.respond(said)
    return {
        "input": said,
        "response": response
    }
```

#### And finally, the _Health_ indicator needed by Kubernetes

```
@app.get("/_healtz")
def healtz():
    return {"version": os.environ.get("VERSION", "???")}
```

To test the service, first run `make install` (ideally within a `venv` or `conda` environment) beforehand to install the necessary dependencies. Then `make run` will start the service listing on [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080).

### [service.json](./service.json)

This file describes the service as needed for the `ivcap service create ...` command.

> The format is still in flux and we most likely going to reference
the approprite section in the [IVCAP Docs](https://ivcap-works.github.io/ivcap-docs/).

### [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)

This file describes a simple configuration for building a docker image for
this service. The make target `make docker-build` will build the image, and
the `make docker-publish` target will upload it to IVCAP.

## Deploying
